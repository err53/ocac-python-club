1. Given a list of numbers, iterate it and return a list of only those numbers which are divisible of 5. Order does not matter.

2. Given a two list of numbers create a new list such that new list should contain only odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list. Order does not matter.

3. Write a Python program to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers.

4. Write a Python program to return a list of all substrings of a given string. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. Eg, "ran" is a substring of "pomeranian". You might want to look up how do use slices in Python. Order does not matter.
