# Week 4 Homework

Write a program to search a list of used cars.

The program should use a Car class to represent a car, which has the following attributes:

- make
- model
- year
- color
- price
- mileage
- a function to calculate the number of miles driven each year

The program should store the cars in a list.

There should be a function to search the database for a car based on the make, model, year, color, and price, and return a list of cars that match the search criteria.

There should be a text-based user interface that runs the function described above, and prints the results in a user-friendly format. Make sure to include error handling.

BONUS:

- Add sorting functionality to the search function.
- Add a function to add and remove cars.
- Add a function to calculate the average price of all cars in a given year.
- Use inheritance to create make-specific Car classes.
- Impress me
