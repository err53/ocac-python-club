exam_st_date = (11, 12, 2014)
print_exam_schedule(examp_st_date)
```

Sample output:

```
The examination will start from: 11 / 12 / 2014

3. Write a Python function to calculate the sum of three given numbers, if the values are equal then return three times of their sum. (Eg, if the values are `1, 1, 1`, return `9`)

Code template:

```py
def funky_sum(a, b, c):
    ...
```

4. Write a Python function to find whether a given number (accept from the user) is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

Code template:

```py
def even_or_odd(number):

```

Sample output:

```
Number is even
```

5. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from user and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers.
