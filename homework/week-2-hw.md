# Week 2 Homework

1. Write a Python function to display the first and last colors from a given list.

   Code template:

   ```py
   def print_list(items):
       ...

   color_list = ["Red", "Green", "White", "Black"]
   print_list(color_list)
   ```

   Sample output:

   ```
   Red, Black
   ```

2. Write a Python function to print the examination schedule from a given date tuple. (extract the date from exam_st_date).

   Code template:

   ```py
   def print_exam_schedule(date):
       ...

   exam_st_date = (11, 12, 2014)
   print_exam_schedule(examp_st_date)
   ```

   Sample output:

   ```
   The examination will start from: 11 / 12 / 2014
   ```

3. Write a Python function to calculate and **return** the sum of three given numbers, if the values are equal then **return** three times of their sum. (Eg, if the values are `1, 1, 1`, return `9`)

   Code template:

   ```py
   def funky_sum(a, b, c):
       ...
   ```

4. Write a Python function to find whether a given number (accept from the user) is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

   Code template:

   ```py
   def even_or_odd(number):
       ...

   even_or_odd(2)
   ```

   Sample output:

   ```
   Number is even
   ```

5. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from user and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers.

   Sample Data:

   ```
   3, 5, 7, 23
   ```

   Hint: look up `.split()` in the Python documentation
