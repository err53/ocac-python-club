# Week 1

## Summary
### Getting Started
Use [Replit](https://replit.com/languages/python3) to write Python code without needing to download anything

### Printing to the console
Print to the console using `print()`:
```python
print("Your text here")
```

### Assigning variables
Assign variables using the `=` operator:
```python
text = "Some more sample text"
```

### String Manipulation
Use `.lower()` to make strings lowercase

Use `.upper()` to make strings uppercase

Use `.isupper()` or `.islower()` to check whether a function is uppercase or lowercase

Use `+` to concatenate strings together

Use `string[x]` to get the `x`th character of the string

### Number Manipulation
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division generally works how you would expect

Use a double slash `//` to do integer division (dropping decimal places)

The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of a number

Use `pow(base, exponent)` to work with exponents

Use `max(a, b)` and `min(a, b)` to find the max and min value between the numbers provided respectively

Use `round(x)` to round a number

Use `floor(x)` and `ceil(x)` after importing the math module with `from math import *`

### Input
Use `input(prompt)` to get user input, and use `=` to assign the input to a variable

## Homework
1. Write a program which accepts the `input` of the radius of a circle from the user and computes the area.
1. Write a program that accepts an `input` of integer (n) and computes the value of n+nn+nnn
1. Write a program that will accept the base and height of a triangle using `input` and compute the area.
1. Write a program to display your details like name, age, and a fun fact about you in three different lines.
1. Write a program that takes any text `input` and makes it capitalized

   **BONUS (Might require Googling / looking at documentation)**
1. Write a program to convert an `input` of seconds to day, hour, minutes and seconds.
1. Write a program to display the current date and time.
1. Write a program to find the index of the first space in the text a user `input`s.

In future homework assignments, use of `input` and `print` will be expected wherever possible
